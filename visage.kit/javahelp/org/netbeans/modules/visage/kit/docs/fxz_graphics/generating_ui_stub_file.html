<h2>Generating a UI Stub File for a Visage Graphic</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> 


<p>When a Visage graphic in FXZ format is included in a NetBeans project,  developers can use it to generate a UI Stub file. A UI stub file is a  shortcut for loading the graphic in the Visage application. A UI stub  file extends <code>FXDNode</code>, loads the graphic, and declares a  variable for each graphic object that has an ID value. You can then  simply refer to the generated class and variables in your Visage  application, because the graphic is loaded in the UI stub.</p>
<p>The UI stub file that is generated has the same name as the Visage graphic plus a <code>UI</code> suffix. For example, if the Visage graphic is named <code>mediaplayer.fxz</code>, the stub file is named <code>mediaplayerUI.fx</code>. The class that is generated also has the name <code>mediaplayerUI</code>.</p>
<p>You do not need  to generate a UI Stub file to use an FXZ graphic in a Visage application. You can load Visage graphics in several ways. For examples of loading graphic in Visage  applications,  see the how-to topic <a href="http://visage.com/docs/howto/Graphics-Tutorial.jsp#loadpsgraphics">How do I load Production Suite graphics?</a></p>
<h3><b>Prerequisites</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Before performing this procedure, you must add the Visage graphic to a NetBeans project. Be sure to identify the Visage graphic with an FXZ or FXD extension. </li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Procedure</b></h3>
<ol>
  <li>In the NetBeans IDE, open the project for your Visage application. </li>
  <li>Locate the FXZ file in the Projects window. </li>
  <li>Right-click (or Control-click on the Mac) the FXZ  file and select <code>Generate UI stub</code>. <br>
    The file is generated and appears in the Projects window.
  </li>
</ol>
