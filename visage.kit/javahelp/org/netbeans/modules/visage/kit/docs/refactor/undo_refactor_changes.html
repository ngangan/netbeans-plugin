<h2>Undoing Refactoring Changes</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small> 


<p>You can undo any changes that you made during refactoring. When you undo a refactoring operation, the IDE rolls back all changes made to all files that were affected by the refactoring. However, if any of the affected files have been modified since refactoring took place,  the Undo operation is not available. </p>
<p><b>To undo a refactoring command: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Choose Refactor > Undo from the main menu.</li>
</ul>
