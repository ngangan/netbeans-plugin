        <h1>Using the Navigator Window (Visage Projects)</h1>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>The Navigator window provides a compact view of the currently selected file 
            and simplifies navigation between different parts of the file. </p>
        
        <p>You can open the Navigator window by choosing Window &gt; Navigating &gt; Navigator (Ctrl-7). 
            By default, the Navigator window opens in the lower left corner of the IDE. 
            To display a source file in the Navigator window, select the file in the Source 
            Editor, the Projects window, the Files window, or the Favorites window. Once
            a file is selected, you can use the Navigator window to focus on a specific 
            code contained in the file. To do so, double-click on a given element in the Navigator 
            window, and your cursor automatically relocates to the element's position in the 
            source file.</p>
        
    <p>When a Visage file is selected, an alphabetical listing of the selected source 
                file's members (classes, functions, and variables) is displayed. You can display the Javadoc documentation for a member by hovering the mouse 
            over the member's element. You can right-click the member's element and choose the following commands:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Go to Source</strong>. Opens the class in the Source Editor and 
                places the insertion point at the beginning of the class, function, 
                or variable that the element represents.</li>
            <li><strong>Sort by Name</strong>. Displays the members in alphabetical order.</li>
            <li><strong>Sort by Source</strong>. Displays the members in the order in 
                which they appear in the code.</li>
            <li><strong>Filters</strong>. Opens a submenu that enables you to select some 
                common filters for the types of members to display. You can select any 
                combination of the following filters:
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Show Inherited Members</strong>. Displays members that
                        come from classes that the current class extends.</li>
                    <li><strong>Show Fields</strong>. Displays the class's fields.</li>
                    <li><strong>Show Static Members</strong>. Displays static fields 
                        and methods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Show Non-Public Members</strong>. Displays members that 
                        do not provide public access.</li>
                </ul></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>You can also activate and disable filters using the buttons at the bottom of 
            the Navigator window.</p>
