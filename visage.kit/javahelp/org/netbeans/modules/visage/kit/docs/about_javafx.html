    <h1>About JavaFX Applications</h1>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small> 

  <p>The  JavaFX™  Plugin for NetBeans provides features for programming in the JavaFX Script programming language.  The JavaFX Script programming language is  declarative and statically typed. It has the 
same code structuring, reuse, and encapsulation features  that make it possible to create and maintain very large programs using the Java 
technology. It
makes intensive use of the JavaFX SDK Runtime's GUI Toolkit  and enables you to easily create  graphical user interfaces or GUIs. To learn more about the JavaFX Script programming language, see the links under the "Reference" section of the

  <p>JavaFX support  in NetBeans IDE includes the following features:</p>
<h3 >JavaFX SDK </h3>
<p>The JavaFX Software Development Kit (SDK) provides the command-line tools and technologies to build and deploy rich internet applications to browsers, desktops, and mobile devices. The JavaFX SDK includes the following components:</p>
 <ul>
   <li> JavaFX  Desktop runtime</li>
 <li>JavaFX Mobile runtime (Microsoft Windows and Mac only)</li>
 <li>JavaFX Mobile Emulator (Microsoft Windows and Mac only)</li>
 <li>JavaFX TV Emulator (Microsoft Windows only)</li>
 <li>JavaFX API documentation</li>
 <li>Samples
    </p>
   </li>
 </ul>
 <p> It is bundled with the JavaFX plugin for NetBeans and is installed in the <code>javafx/javafx-sdk</code> directory in your NetBeans installation directory. It is set as the default platform to use for the JavaFX projects created in the IDE. For more information, see <a href="project/javafx_proj_sdk.html">Setting the Target JavaFX SDK in a JavaFX Project</a>. </p>
<h3 >JavaFX Compiler</h3>
<p>The JavaFX Compiler is also integrated with the JavaFX  plugin and is used to compile JavaFX source code. Java source code that is included in the JavaFX projects are compiled with the 
Java compiler. The results of the compilation are placed into one JAR file, which can be used for 
deployment or distribution. For more information, see <a href="compile/javafx_comp_about.html">About Building JavaFX Applications</a>. </p>
<h3 >Advanced Source Code Editor</h3>
<p>The language-aware  editor indents and completes  your source code written in the JavaFX Script programming
language. The editor also performs semantic syntax highlighting, live parsing of your code, 
matches words and brackets, marks errors
and occurrences, has code completion functionality, and has code folding capability. It has a toolbar that includes controls to enable 
or disable the preview feature. For more information, see 
<a href="editing/editing_javafx_source.html">Editing JavaFX  Source Files</a>.
<h3 >JavaFX Palette</h3>
<p>The JavaFX Palette provides code snippets that you can use to quickly build your JavaFX application. The code snippets can be dragged and dropped into the source file that is currently opened in the source editor. For more information, see 
<a href="editing/about_javafx_palette.html">About the JavaFX Palette</a>.
<h3>Preview Feature </h3>
<p>The JavaFX plugin includes a preview feature   that allows you to view the effects of the changes you make to your source code without having to build and run your application each time you make any changes.  If there are no compilation errors encountered and the source file represents  UI components, Shape, or Frame classes, changes you make in the source editor will be displayed in the canvas pane located just above the source editor pane. For more information, see <a href="editing/using_javafxpreview.html">Using JavaFX Preview Feature.</a> </p>
<h3>Debugger</h3>
<p>Currently, the debugger feature included with the JavaFX plugin supports debugging of both JavaFX and Java source code that is included in a JavaFX  project. For more information, see <a href="debug/javafx_debug_about.html">Debugging JavaFX Applications.</a>  </p>
<h3>Profiler</h3>
<p>The Profiler feature is available at the project-level  only and not at the source level for JavaFX projects. For more information, see <a href="profiling/javafx_profile_about.html">Profiling JavaFX Applications.</a> </p>
<h3>Package for Deployment </h3>
<p>The Project Properties dialog allows you to configure and choose the execution model to use to run your JavaFX application. The IDE uses this configuration to create the necessary files to package the application for deployment outside of the IDE.  For more information, see <a href="deploy/javafx_deploy_prep.html">Preparing JavaFX Applications for Deployment.</a> </p>
