<h2>Viewing the JavaFX Graphics </h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> 


<p>The NetBeans IDE provides tools to help you work with JavaFX Content  File (FXZ) graphics that are exported from JavaFX Production Suite.  Once you bring an FXZ file into a JavaFX project, you can work with it  in the following ways.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Add the FXZ file to a NetBeans project to view it. You add the FXZ file by copying it to a selected project's folder on your disk. If you open an FXZ file using the Open File command, you will not be able to see the structure of the FXZ file in the Projects window. Also, if the graphic was saved from Adobe Illustrator CS4 with the Use Artboards feature, you will not be able to view the descriptions contained in individual FXD files unless you uncompress the FXZ file first with a standard compression utility.</p>
<h3><b>View the Image</b></h3>
<p>To view an FXZ graphic, open the FXZ file in the Source Editor, then click the Preview button in the FXZ toolbar. You have the following options when viewing images.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the graphic was saved from Adobe Illustrator CS4 with the Use Artboards feature, select the FXD file corresponding to the artboard in Scene field of the FXZ toolbar. </li>
  <li>Change the magnification of the graphic by changing the magnification setting or clicking the zoom icons in the FXZ toolbar. 
  </li>
  <li>Select individual objects in the graphic to see the corresponding FXD element and its properties in the Navigator window. </li>
  <li><b>Note:</b> If your graphic includes individual artboards, make sure you have selected the correct artboard so you can select the graphic objects in the Preview window. </li>
  <li>Click the back, forward, or up arrow in the FXZ toolbar to show the previous FXD element, the next FXD element, or the parent FXD element, respectively. </li>
  <li>Click the Toggle Tooltip icon in the FXZ toolbar to display FXD properties of a graphic object in a tooltip when selected. </li>
  <li>Click the Toggle Preview icon in the FXZ toolbar to highlight the current selection. </li>
</ul>

<h3><b>View the Source Description</b></h3>
<p>You can view the source description of an object in any of the following ways.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open an FXZ file, then click the Source button in the FXZ toolbar. </li>
  <li>To display the source description of a single graphic object, double-click the graphic object in the Preview screen. </li>
  <li>Double-click an FXD element in the Navigator window. </li>
</ul>

<h3><b>View and Modify the Contents of FXZ Files</b></h3>
<p>FXZ files are compressed archives. You can view the files contained within the FXZ file in any of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the Projects window, click the arrow next to the FXZ file. </li>
  <li>Open the FXZ file, then click the Archive button in the FXZ toolbar. <br>
This view provides more information about file size, and you can use the FXZ toolbar to add new FXD files, insert supporting graphics files, and remove or replace existing files. </li>
</ul>
