<h2>About Refactoring JavaFX Code</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small> 


<p>Refactoring is a process of  modifying a program's source code without changing the program's functional behavior. The aim of refactoring is to improve code readability, simplicity and performance. Additional benefits of refactoring  include improved maintainability and extensibility of your code.

<p>The IDE's refactoring feature makes code restructuring easier by evaluating  requested changes, providing a summary of all parts of the code that are affected, and making necessary changes to the code when  you proceed with refactoring. For example, if you choose to rename a variable, the IDE shows you every usage of the variable's name in your application and then changes each occurence of that name for you.</p>
